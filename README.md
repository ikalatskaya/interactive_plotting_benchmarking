# Interactive plotting benchmarking

## Intro

Visualizations grant users the ability to explore, manipulate, and interact with data by employing dynamic charts, changing colors, and shapes based on queries or interactions. 

HTML widgets work just like R plots except they produce interactive web visualizations. HTML widgets can be used at the R console as well as embedded in R Markdown reports and Shiny web applications. 

## Objectives

Interactivity: long lasting RShiny apps should be interactive and self-explicit. R packages that support html widgets might help achive this goal pretty easily: plot_ly, ggplotly, highcharter, bokeh or echart? 

## Product

We have build an Rshiny dashboard that shows and compares five different R packages that help to build interactive plots for Rshiny dashboards and Rmarkdowns.
